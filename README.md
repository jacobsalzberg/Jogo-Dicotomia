# Jogo-Dicotomia-UI

Jogo-Dicotomia-Ui is a simple game based on dichotomic search, a specific case of binary search, with a fully random initial guess instead de x0=(xmin+xmax)/2. The game also has hardcoded a maximum number of iterations as a *set* value.

There's a convergency test (and *de facto*, the algorithm always converges) with the set maximum number of iterations (itmax=8). If it>itmax, the player beats the computer.
